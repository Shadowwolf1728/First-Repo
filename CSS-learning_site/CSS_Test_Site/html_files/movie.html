    <li>Josh B 5 stars I love this movie, the casting is just great and all of the people fit their roles. Also the soundtrack is astounding as well as the animation. Straight 10/10</li>
    <li>Yojin C 5 stars The combination of a great animation style and a compelling story is soo good. I mean who couldnt see himself in Miles, struggling with his new powers and the high expectations?</li>

    <li>Daniel B half star Utter garbage. The animation style is horrible and barely watchable and the plot is dull dull dull with an even duller lead. Even The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was better than this. </li>
    <li>John B 1 star Found this very boring. Another superhero movie that relies on a multiverse and excessive amounts of irony, self-reference, making fun of the genre, etc. Boilerplate stuff at this point. Flabbergasted by how well-reviewed this is, because it's so incredibly mediocre, meandering, and mid. Also, the fact that this is a "Spiderman" movie is entirely incidental. It's really more of a send-up of superhero movies in general. Great if you're 10 years old I guess</li>

    <li>Thomas A 5 stars My favorite movie of all-time. An original idea, brilliantly written, directed, and acted. A sci-fi comedy with an amazing hero, anmazing characters, an amazing friendship, and a great story. This movie falls into the golden era of 80s movie making in that it was an original idea written as a movie that would not have worked better in any other medium</li>

    <li>Moste m 2 and half stars  its wildly overrated its only Mildly entertaining because of the predictions they made about the future, but the story is so lacking and it shows that this movie is is average at best. </li>
    <li>Starwarsromania .5 stars  Although it remains a popular ‘80s classic, Back To The Future has quite weak acting and very boring elements.</li>

Summary
</h3>
<p>
Within the movie Jurassic Park, we begin on the island of Isla Nublar where the mind of Dr.Alan Grant and the money of rich industrialist  John Hammond help create a theme park using cloned dinosaurs. While on this island we follow the grandchildren of Hammond, Lex and Tim who were invited to the island and join a tour group to see all of the dinosaurs there. Their time on the island is cut short as a tropical storm approaches and they return to their electric tour vehicle to return to safety. As they are doing this, a very discontented computer programmer bribed by a corporate rival of Hammond shuts down the tour vehicles and the park’s electric fences. This is done as the tour group is near the Tyrannosaurus enclosure and are attacked by it. They are luckily able to escape it with a large amount of trouble and leave the island through a helicopter.

    <li>Arnold V 4 and half star This is what a blockbuster movie is for me. Big, majestic and scenes that still remain a defining moment in cinema. It's a smart movie, with great characters and lovely on-screen chemistry. And the effects have aged amazingly. If you really want to nitpick, there are moments that will give you that opportunity. For me, those are minor. The movie is an experience and best viewed in a movie theatre.</li>
    <li>Ryland C 5 stars I don't know a SINGLE PERSON who hates this movie. Jurassic Park had a premise that was so simple and made it fun, exiting, and magical! Definitely in my top 10 favorite movies ever!</li>

    <li>Benjamin H half star This film is a bit unrealistic since the existence of dinosaurs has not been proven. There may be some bones but these are easy enough to fake.</li>
    <li>Jack L half star i wish the dinosaurs talked it would help the plot make sense and it was no terror of tiny town</li>
